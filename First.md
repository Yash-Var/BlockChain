### What is BlockChain?
- BlockChain is a distributed immutable ledger which is completely transparent.
### Application of BlockChain :-
- Products Tracking 
- HealthCare System
- Smart Contracts 
- International wire transfer
### Hashing Algorithm
#### The five requirements of hash algorithm
- one way
- Deterministic
- with stand collisions
- Fast computation
### Immutable ledger
### P2P Network
### Centralized Network
### Distributed P2P Network in BlockChain
### BlockChain Mining 
Transaction -> Solve Mathematical problem -> Miner solved problem first -> Miners verify the validity -> Block is added
### Byzantine Gemerals Problem
### Consensus Protocol
- Prevent attacks
- Competing Chain Problem
